Render the video found in the public folder on the page. Make it as pretty (or as ugly) as you like. In the public/images folder you will find three images that should render in the following ways during the video playing. Timings are in reference to the current time of the video. Using a native html5 video component is preferred. You can also migrate this to use typescript if you'd prefer.

Feel free to ask any questions, as well as to have fun and expand on the specification as much as you like (e.g. custom controls, fullscreen toggle button, a button that runs away from your cursor). 

If you're struggling, take notes about areas you are having trouble with, proposed solutions you have considered etc.

Please send us a link to your new repo. Alongside this, please provide a screen recorded video or text-documented walkthrough and overview of your development process where you describe the process behind building the app and run through any thoughts you had, decisions you made, concerns that came up etc.
